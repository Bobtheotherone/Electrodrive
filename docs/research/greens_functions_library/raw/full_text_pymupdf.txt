Planar Stratified Media Green’s Functions (Electrostatics)
Half‐Space  (Single  Interface): For  a  point  charge   at  height   above  a  planar  interface  between
permittivities 
 (above, where the charge resides) and 
 (below), the potential in the upper region can be
written as the superposition of the original charge and an image charge. The image magnitude is 
= 
, located at the mirror point symmetrically below the plane
. (Notably, if 
, then 
 has
the same sign as , implying a repulsive interaction – charges are repelled from lower-permittivity regions
.) The potential for 
 is then:
in cylindrical coordinates (ρ horizontal distance)
. This satisfies the interface conditions: continuity of 
at 
 and continuity of normal 
 (no surface charge at the boundary)
. In the lower region 
, the field is uniform with no internal image charge; one finds 
 with 
 so
that 
 is continuous
. Equivalently, the potential in 
 behaves as if the free charge were
effectively scaled by a factor 
 (for 
 above, 
 is as if charge 
 were in
vacuum). In the extreme cases, (i)
 (conducting lower half-space) gives 
 and the familiar
image method for a grounded plane
; (ii)
 (infinitely “low” permittivity) gives 
 (image of
same sign, fully repulsive). The induced bound surface-charge density on the interface is 
, which for a conductor (
) recovers 
. The force on
the point charge due to the interface is 
 (attractive for 
, repulsive if 
). The
image formulation above is in fact an exact solution for the static half-space problem
. 
Spectral Integral Representation: The same result can be obtained by a Fourier/Sommerfeld integral. The
full-space Green’s function in homogeneous medium is  
. For the half-space, one finds an
azimuthal Fourier-Bessel transform:
with 
 (static limit of the TM-wave reflection coefficient)
. Evaluating the
integral yields the above image expression. The term with 
 corresponds to the reflected field from
the interface. For multi-layer planar stratifications, one obtains multiple reflections: e.g. for a 3-layer (two
interfaces) system, the Green’s function can be written as a similar Sommerfeld integral but with a 
frequency-dependent reflection coefficient 
 that is a rational function encoding multiple internal
reflections. Barrera, Guzmán & Balaguer (1978) used the method of images to derive such integrals for a

three-dielectric planar configuration
. The resulting potential expressions involve piecewise-defined
integrals (or infinite image charge series) for each region that satisfy the boundary conditions at both
interfaces. In general, no finite number of discrete image charges can exactly represent the field in multi-
layer dielectric media; instead one obtains either infinite image series or continuous distributions
(integrals). For instance, a point charge between two dielectric half-spaces produces an infinite series of
images in each layer (analogous to multiple mirror images in a Fabry–Pérot cavity) which sums to the exact
Green’s function
. These series/integrals converge rapidly when the source is far from the interfaces,
but can converge slowly for near-interface sources or high-contrast interfaces. Various techniques
(asymptotic extraction, Ewald summation, numerical steepest-descent integration) are used to accelerate
convergence of Sommerfeld integrals
. For quasi-static problems, it is common to partition the
Green’s function into a “direct” term plus a rapidly decaying reflected field; e.g. one can subtract the 
singular contribution and handle it analytically, then integrate the remainder numerically with fewer
discretization points
. Approximations via discrete image charges are also used: for example, Wait &
Spies (1964) proposed complex image charges to approximate the Sommerfeld integral of a dipole field in a
conductive half-space
 (the complex image method), achieving high accuracy by fitting a few images to
the continuous spectrum. Similar rational approximations exist for static/dc fields in layered media to avoid
direct integration. However, these are approximations; the exact solution generally resides in the spectral
integral form or an infinite series of images. 
Planar Layer Examples: A classical example is a charge on the interface (say in medium 1 at 
): it
induces a surface charge of magnitude 
 on the boundary such that the field in medium 2 is as if a charge
 were placed at the interface
. Another case: a charge embedded in a dielectric slab
of finite thickness between two different dielectric half-spaces. By multiple reflections, one can sum an
infinite geometric series of image charges in each region. If the slab is symmetric (same permittivity above
and below), the series simplifies (even and odd image symmetry). If the slab is very thin (small thickness
compared to source distance), asymptotic methods can treat the two interfaces as a single effective
interface  with  an  effective  reflection  coefficient  
 etc.,  accurate  to  
 where   is
thickness. If the source is very close to one interface (small gap), the first image dominates and higher-
order images (multiple reflections) contribute corrections that can be expanded in powers of the small
parameter. Conversely, if the source is far, one can expand the field as the free-space field plus a dipole term
proportional to 
 (for a distant charge, the interface effect looks like an induced dipole
layer). 
Key References (Planar Media): The plane interface problem was treated by Sommerfeld (1909) for EM
fields (the static limit yields the above forms).  Landau & Lifshitz derive the image charge result for a
dielectric half-space in Electrodynamics of Continuous Media (Problem 1 to §8). Jackson (3rd ed, §4.4) also
covers a point charge above a dielectric half-space (leading to a surface-charge integral solution and the
image-charge interpretation).  Ramo, Whinnery & Van Duzer (Fields and Waves, 1965) give the closed-
form solution for the static interface using Fourier transforms
. For multiple planar layers, Barrera
et al, Am. J. Phys. 46, 1172 (1978) gave explicit Fourier-integral forms (corrected by Serra et al (2015) for
sign errors
). The general formalism for layered media Green’s functions is given in texts like Chew
(1990) and  Kong (1986), using transmission line analogies for the reflection coefficient  
. In static
cases,  
 becomes real and non-dispersive (independent of   for Laplace’s equation), which is why the
integrals often evaluate to simple image expressions – indeed for a purely dielectric discontinuity the
integrand  
 is constant, allowing analytic integration to yield the simple  
 form. This
ceases to be true for frequency-dependent or more complicated stratifications, where

Green’s Functions for Spherical Boundaries (Method of Images for
Spheres)
Conducting Sphere (Kelvin’s Image Charge): A point charge   in an infinite homogeneous medium at
distance  from the center of a grounded conducting sphere (radius 
) induces an image charge 
 located along the line from the center through the real charge, at radius  
 from the
center
. This Kelvin image produces a potential that exactly cancels 
 on the conductor surface. The
resulting Green’s function (Dirichlet, 
 on sphere) is:
for a source at 
 outside the sphere (with 
). The induced surface charge density is found by the
image method as well: 
 for a point charge on the polar axis
, and the total induced charge is 
 (the conductor shields the external field)
. Kelvin (1845)
discovered this solution
, which was a cornerstone in the development of the method of images. The 
reciprocal problem (charge inside a grounded sphere) also yields a single image: if  is at radius 
inside, then an image 
 at radius 
 outside produces zero potential on the sphere
.
These classic results are given in Maxwell’s treatise and many textbooks (e.g. Smythe, Static & Dynamic
Electricity, 1968, provides derivations). Neumann (1883) already discussed the sphere image problem and
its relation to inversion symmetry
. The method can be generalized to other conductor shapes that are 
spherical inversions of a plane or sphere: e.g. a conducting spherical shell with inner/outer radii yields
image charges for interior/exterior problems via Kelvin inversion (a charge outside a grounded spherical
shell induces one image outside and one inside the shell). Another example: a conducting circular cylinder
can be solved by images in 2D (line charges); Kelvin inversion maps it to a line and sphere configuration.
These are all special cases where a finite set of image multipoles yields an exact solution. 
Dielectric Sphere in Homogeneous Medium: For a point charge near a dielectric (non-conducting) sphere,
no finite set of simple images exists – instead the solution can be expanded in an infinite series of
multipoles (or interpreted as an image  distribution inside the sphere). Consider a sphere of radius  ,
permittivity 
, in an infinite medium 
. Place a charge  at distance  from the center (outside the sphere).
The potential outside (
) can be expanded in spherical harmonics about the sphere:  
 
(with
 
).  Inside  the  sphere  (
),
 
. Applying the boundary conditions at 
 (continuity of 
 and 
) leads to the
coefficients (for 
):
For example, the dipole term
 gives 
, corresponding to an induced dipole
moment

. The infinite series can be summed in closed form only in limiting cases (e.g. 
 reduces to the
Kelvin image solution where only 
 term survives
). In general, the image representation is an
infinite sequence: one can show that the same solution is obtained by replacing the sphere with an infinite
set of point charges located on the line through the sphere center and the original charge (a convergent
sequence approaching the center). In fact, the classic analysis by Kirkwood (1934) interprets the series as
an infinite image charge expansion for reaction field calculations. Norris (1995)】 explicitly constructed
the image system: a point charge 
 at the Kelvin image point 
plus a continuous line
distribution of charge along the radius from the center to that image point
. This line-charge
density can be chosen so that each term of its multipole expansion reproduces the series coefficients
above. (For 
, a continuous distribution is needed – a single point image is insufficient
.)
The image line charge formulation is discussed by Norris and by Lindell (Radio Sci., 27:1–8, 1992)
, who termed it an “electrostatic image theory” for the dielectric sphere. In summary, unlike the
conducting sphere, no finite combination of discrete images can satisfy both 
 and 
 continuity for a
dielectric sphere
. The infinite-series solution (or equivalent image distribution) is the accepted
Green’s function. The series converges for field points outside the sphere if 
, and for field points
inside if 
. It converges faster when the contrast 
 is small (since higher-order multipoles
have coefficients 
) and when the charge is not too close to the sphere. If the charge
approaches the sphere (
), the series develops a slow convergence (the terms 
approach 1) and many multipoles are needed – this corresponds to the known strong field
enhancement in narrow gaps. In fact, as 
, the needed truncation order 
 to achieve a given
accuracy grows roughly like 
, where  is a factor related to 
. Practically, for 
 (10% gap), perhaps tens of terms suffice; for 
 (1% gap), hundreds of terms may
be required to capture the near-contact singular field. Techniques like the use of spherical harmonics
of the second kind (logarithmic potentials) aka “logopoles”** have been developed by Majic & Le Ru
(2019) to accelerate convergence in this regime
. These functions effectively capture the line-charge
singularity inside the sphere, yielding a more rapidly convergent expansion than standard Legendre series. 
If the point charge is  inside a dielectric sphere (radius  , permittivity  
) embedded in medium  
, one
similarly expands in harmonics. The roles of interior/exterior solutions swap: inside we have a Coulomb plus
reflected series, outside purely multipole series. The coefficients become 
 for 
, etc. When 
 (sphere in a conducting medium), only the 
 term survives inside (uniform field),
consistent with the image-charge result that a dielectric sphere in a conducting host induces a single image
outside at 
 (for a charge at radius 
)
. A curious fact noted by van Siclen (AJP 56, 1142
(1988)) is that if one places the Kelvin image charge inside a dielectric sphere (instead of the proper infinite
series), the external field it produces together with the real external charge is independent of 
. In
other words, the combination “external charge + Kelvin image” yields the correct outside potential for any
sphere permittivity (equal to the conducting-sphere solution). Of course, the interior field will be wrong
except in the conductor limit – but this trick implies that the effect of finite  
 is felt only in the  higher
multipole terms (which vanish if 
). This was generalized by Redžić et al (2012) to spheroidal cases
. Practically, it suggests using the Kelvin image as a starting approximation for large but finite 
, adding
corrections  for  the  residual  multipoles.  Indeed,  Kirkwood  (1957) and  Friedman  (1975) introduced
approximate  image-charge  methods  to  replace  the  full  series  in  molecular  solvation  models
.
Kirkwood’s  approximation  is  essentially  truncating  at  the  dipole  term  (using  one  image);  Friedman
proposed a single image located at the Kelvin image point but with magnitude chosen to match the exact
dipole moment (improving accuracy for moderate contrasts)
. These give errors on the order of a few
percent for low or moderate permittivity ratios and are widely used in “reaction field” models of solvent

dielectrics
. Modern extensions use multiple discrete images (e.g. 3 or 4 image charges per sphere) to
fit higher multipole moments, yielding accuracies of 10^(-4) with far fewer terms than the full series
.
Such methods, combined with FMM (fast multipole method), allow efficient  
 simulations of many-
charge systems with dielectric spheres
. 
Coated (Layered) Spheres: A  dielectric-coated conducting sphere is another geometry amenable to
analytic solution. Suppose a conducting core radius  is covered by a concentric dielectric shell (outer radius
, permittivity 
), embedded in medium 
. A point charge in the outside region can be solved by matching
boundary conditions at 
 (dielectric interface) and 
 (conductor). One finds an infinite series again:
outside
 
,
 
;  in  the  shell
 
,
 
; inside the conductor  
,  
. The coefficients are determined by applying (i)
 at 
 (implying 
), and (ii) continuity of 
 and 
 at 
. The algebra
leads to formulas for 
 in terms of 
. These are lengthy, but in special cases they simplify. Pyati
(Radio Sci. 28:1105, 1993) applied Kelvin inversion to this problem
: using the fact that inversion in a
sphere of radius  
 maps the coated sphere to a simpler geometry, he obtained an analytic image
solution. Essentially, the presence of the coating means the image of a charge is no longer a single charge:
one gets a doublet of images – an image charge and an image dipole (or higher multipole) located at the
Kelvin image point – to satisfy the two conditions at the interface. For example, for a very  thin coating
(
, 
), one can treat the coating as a perturbation: the image charge is approximately Kelvin’s
, plus a small dipole at the same location to account for the finite 
. The dipole moment can be
solved from a first-order perturbation of the boundary condition: it comes out proportional to 
,
which for large 
 is small. Conversely, if the shell permittivity is low, the dipole moment might reinforce the
primary image (if 
, the dipole term adds a repulsive component). In general, series solutions for
coated spheres are given in treatises like Stratton’s Electromagnetic Theory (1941, §3.25) and in many
antenna-scattering analyses (the static limit of Mie theory). The coefficients often involve the spherical
harmonic recursion for three-layer systems. The effect of the coating is to modify the effective polarization
of the sphere: e.g. the polarizability of a coated metal sphere is  
,
which reduces to the earlier 
 for 
, and to the perfect conductor value (polarizability 
) as
. This indicates that a high-  coating can nearly mimic a metal even if the core is just metal (which is
already conductor, trivial here) – more interesting is a dielectric core with a different coating, which can
produce resonant polarization effects if  
 is lower than  
. Generally, however, no  finite set of simple
images exists for coated spheres either; one again deals with infinite series or images of increasing
multipole order. Pyati’s work shows that Kelvin’s inversion can simplify the algebra but still yields an infinite
series of image multipoles (just in a perhaps more organized way). 
Multiple Spheres and Sphere–Plane Configurations: The method of images can be iterated to handle two
conducting spheres or a sphere near a conducting plane, but the result is an infinite recursive series of
images. For example, a conducting sphere above a conducting infinite plane: the plane induces an image
charge (Kelvin’s method for a plane says put 
 below the plane); but that image below the plane is like a
point charge near the sphere (below it), which induces another image in the sphere, which then induces
another in the plane, and so on ad infinitum. Physically, the two objects “mirror” charges back and forth. In
fact, using the sphere’s Kelvin formula and the plane’s mirror formula alternately yields an infinite sequence
of image charges of geometrically decreasing magnitude. In the sphere-plane case, these image charges lie
on the perpendicular axis through the sphere center, at progressively smaller distances, and the series
converges fast if the gap 
 is not too small. In the limit 
 (sphere almost touching the plane),
the  method-of-images  series  converges  slowly;  instead  one  can  use  the  method  of  bispherical

coordinates. Bispherical coordinates exploit the fact that equipotentials of two-sphere systems are level
surfaces of a certain coordinate ; the Green’s function for two conducting spheres (or a sphere and a plane
as the plane is a sphere of infinite radius) can be expanded in Legendre functions 
 of non-integer degree
(the so-called toroidal harmonics). This yields an exact infinite series for the potential, from which one can
extract asymptotic behavior. For small  , the capacitance  
 of a sphere-plane system behaves as  
 (like a quasi-parallel plate with a logarithmic correction) – this comes from the
dominant large-  behavior of the series. The field in the narrow gap is extremely high (formally  
 on  small  patch  area  
),  so  discretization  of  charge  images  can  become  ill-conditioned.
Numerical solvers (BEM, etc.) use mesh refinement in the gap and on the sphere’s near-face to capture this
boundary-layer field. Often a proximity parameter
 is used: for 
, one can derive a singular
asymptotic expansion for the field: e.g. the maximum surface field on the sphere scales like  
times the field of an isolated sphere. Error estimates for truncating the image series: if we truncate after 
image pairs (sphere-plane iterations), the error in potential near the gap is on the order of the next image
charge magnitude 
. For large separation 
, only the first image (plane’s 
) is
significant and the error decays as 
 – very fast. 
For  two finite spheres (both conducting), the image method likewise gives an infinite double series of
point charges inside each sphere. This was studied by King (1934) and others; the exact series solution for
two-sphere capacitance and force was derived by Lord Rayleigh (1897) using bispherical harmonics. There
is no simple closed-form formula; one must sum the series or use approximation formulas valid in certain
limits (e.g. small  or large ). For mixed dielectric spheres influencing each other, one can again set up
dual infinite series of multipoles. For instance, two dielectric spheres in vacuum will polarize each other: one
can expand each sphere’s response in multipoles, with coefficients that depend on the external field applied
by the other sphere’s multipoles – this leads to a  matrix equation coupling the two sets of coefficients.
Solving that yields a double series (the method is analogous to multiple scattering theory). Only in limiting
cases (like one sphere much larger than the other, or extreme permittivity ratios) can one find simplified
image approximations.  Fikioris (1977) and others have looked at two-sphere polarization; generally one
must truncate for numerical evaluation. 
Sphere near a Dielectric Interface: This hybrid problem (e.g. a dielectric or conducting sphere close to a
dielectric  half-space)  is  very  challenging  analytically.  No  closed-form  Green’s  function  is  known.  One
approach is the method of images with multipoles: the presence of the interface can be accounted by an
infinite set of image multipoles (located as a mirror distribution of the sphere’s charges) plus possibly
continuous distributions. For example, a conducting sphere above a dielectric plane might be approximated
by combining the sphere-plane image series (assuming the plane is conducting) with corrections for the
fact that the plane is actually dielectric. Another approach: use  bispherical coordinates if the sphere
intersects the plane (for a sphere partially embedded in a dielectric, effectively two-sphere coordinates with
one sphere of infinite radius). Some special cases have analytic results:  e.g. a conducting sphere half-
embedded in a dielectric half-space – by symmetry, this can be treated by image charges distributed along a
line (like the method of  odd extension across the interface, yielding an integral equation). In general,
however,  these  mixed  problems  are  solved  with  numerical  methods  (BEM  or  multipole  expansions
truncated at high order). 
Failure of Finite Image Solutions: In summary, apart from the canonical geometries (plane, sphere,
infinite cylinder,  maybe ellipsoid in certain orientations),  finite discrete image systems do not exist for
most conductor–dielectric setups
. The method of images “fails” in the sense that one needs either
an infinite number of images or an image distribution (line, surface, etc.). A famous example is the dielectric

sphere: no finite collection of Coulomb charges can satisfy the boundary conditions
. Another example:
an ellipsoidal conductor requires an infinite series of images lying along a line (the so-called Pellat’s solution
involves an integral of line charges). Similarly, a  point charge in front of a dielectric slab cannot be
represented by a few images – one gets a continuous charge “image” smeared along the perpendicular
through the slab. These impossibility results stem from the uniqueness theorem: the Green’s function in
such cases has branch-cut singularities (the continuous spectra corresponding to continuum of image
charges). A rigorous statement is that the method of images in the form of finite discrete sources works iff
the boundary is an equipotential of a conformal inversion of a sphere or plane (so basically plane, sphere, or
special cases like coaxal cylinders in 2D). For arbitrary shapes or layered media, one resorts to infinite series
or integrals. 
Parameter  Scaling  &  Numerical  Considerations: It  is  crucial  to  nondimensionalize  lengths  by  a
characteristic scale (sphere radius, etc.) and to form contrast parameters that govern the solution. Common
dimensionless groups include the permivitty contrast
 (which appeared in many formulas above
as image-charge factors), the normalized separation
 (distance of a charge or second object in
units of sphere radius), and the gap ratio
. In series expansions, small  can be used as an expansion
parameter (for instance, for a weakly polarizable sphere, 
). In contrast, 
(huge contrast in either direction) is a singular limit – e.g. 
 corresponds to a perfect conductor image.
One often expands about those extremes: for a high-  sphere, one can write 
 where
 is 0 for 
 and 
 is proportional to 
. This yields a small parameter 
. Likewise, for a low-
 inclusion, one can treat it as a small perturbation (since 
, one might set 
 with 
 and
expand). As for geometry, small gap
 expansions often use 
 as a parameter: e.g. capacitance of
sphere-plane has an asymptotic expansion in powers of  
 and  
. For  far-field expansions, one
uses 
: e.g. the potential of a sphere of charge 
 at large distance looks like 
 dipole
term + etc., with each successive multipole 
. Truncating at dipole yields an error 
.
Many numerical schemes (method of moments, multipole accelerators) leverage such truncation for distant
interactions. 
When  implementing  image-based  solutions  or  series  numerically,  one  must  ensure  convergence and
stability. For example, the Legendre series for a dielectric sphere can suffer catastrophic cancellation for
large  if summed naively; using recurrence relations or log-scaling for the coefficients is recommended. In
boundary element collocation, placing collocation points near sharp edges or small gaps is essential: e.g.
for a sphere near a plane, a finer mesh (or denser sampling for the method of moments) is needed in the
region of closest approach, because induced surface charge density behaves like 
 near the
contact point (a square-root singularity). Mesh grading proportional to 
 is often used
to capture this. In iterative image constructions, one monitors the magnitude of the last-added image
charge: stopping when it falls below some tolerance ensures the error in potential is bounded by that
magnitude. For instance, in the two-sphere problem, if the 
th image has charge 
, the error in potential
is 
; since 
 (for large ) or 
 (for small gap), one can estimate how
many images are required. 
Known Results Summary: To conclude this technical compendium, we list some notable special-case
solutions and references: (1) A charge above a dielectric half-space – exact potential via one image charge
(with magnitude 
)
, first derived by Sommerfeld and found in many textbooks
(e.g. Jackson, Eq. 4.19). (2) Charge outside a grounded conducting sphere – Kelvin’s image solution (1845)
. (3) Charge outside a dielectric sphere – infinite series solution (e.g. Stratton 1941, p. 147; Kirkwood

).  (5) Coated sphere with

Two conducting spheres – bispherical harmonic expansion (see Jeffery 1912, Snow 1952 for capacitance
series). (7) Dielectric sphere-plane – no closed form; see Image multipole method by Zhukauskas 1988
(approximate) or numerical BEM. (8) General layered Green’s function – spectral integrals (Sommerfeld) as
in Chew’s “Waves and Fields in Inhomogeneous Media” (1990). (9) Novel solution techniques – e.g. Majic
& Le Ru (2019) “logopoles” for fast sphere series
; Yaghjian (1980) for complex images in stratified
media. These sources provide a wealth of formulas, convergence analysis, and guidance for tackling new
configurations that might admit near-analytic solutions via clever combinations of known Green’s functions
and transforms.
