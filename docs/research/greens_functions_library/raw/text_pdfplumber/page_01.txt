Planar Stratified Media Green’s Functions (Electrostatics)
Half‐Space (Single Interface):  For a point charge  q  at height  d  above a planar interface between
permittivities ϵ1 (above, where the charge resides) and ϵ2 (below), the potential in the upper region can be
written as the superposition of the original charge and an image charge. The image magnitude is 
q′
ϵ −ϵ
=  ϵ1+ϵ2 q, located at the mirror point symmetrically below the plane 1 . (Notably, if ϵ2 < ϵ1, then q′ has
1 2
the same sign as q, implying a repulsive interaction – charges are repelled from lower-permittivity regions
1 .) The potential for z > 0 is then:
q 1 ϵ −ϵ 1
V (ρ,z) = + 1 2 ,
above 4πϵ1[ ρ2+(z−d)2 ϵ1+ϵ2 ρ2+(z+d)2]
in cylindrical coordinates (ρ horizontal distance) 2 . This satisfies the interface conditions: continuity of V
at z = 0 and continuity of normal ϵEz (no surface charge at the boundary) 3 2 . In the lower region 
z < 0, the field is uniform with no internal image charge; one finds Ez<0 = (1−ν)Eorig with ν = ϵϵ22+−ϵϵ11 so
that Ez is continuous 4 5 . Equivalently, the potential in z < 0 behaves as if the free charge were
effectively scaled by a factor 2ϵ1/(ϵ1+ϵ2) 6  (for ϵ1 = 1 above, Vz<0 is as if charge 2q/(ϵ1+ϵ2) were in
vacuum). In the extreme cases, (i)ϵ2 → ∞ (conducting lower half-space) gives q′ = −q and the familiar
image method for a grounded plane 2 ; (ii)ϵ2 → 0 (infinitely “low” permittivity) gives q′ = +q (image of
same sign, fully repulsive). The induced bound surface-charge density on the interface is σb(ρ) =
−ν qd 7 8 , which for a conductor (ν = 1) recovers σ(ρ) = − qd 9 10 . The force on
2π(ρ2+d2)3/2 2π(ρ2+d2)3/2
the point charge due to the interface is Fz = −16πqϵ0qϵ′1d2 (attractive for ϵ2 > ϵ1, repulsive if ϵ2 < ϵ1). The
image formulation above is in fact an exact solution for the static half-space problem 11 12 . 
Spectral Integral Representation: The same result can be obtained by a Fourier/Sommerfeld integral. The
full-space Green’s function in homogeneous medium is G0 = 4π1ϵR1. For the half-space, one finds an
azimuthal Fourier-Bessel transform:
1 ∞ 1
G(ρ,z,z′) = e−k∣z−z′∣+R (k)e−k(z+z′) J (kρ)kdk,
2π ∫ 2ϵ k[ p ] 0
0 1
with Rp(k) = (ϵ1−ϵ2)/(ϵ1+ϵ2) (static limit of the TM-wave reflection coefficient) 6 2 . Evaluating the
integral yields the above image expression. The term with e−k(z+z′) corresponds to the reflected field from
the interface. For multi-layer planar stratifications, one obtains multiple reflections: e.g. for a 3-layer (two
interfaces) system, the Green’s function can be written as a similar Sommerfeld integral but with a 
frequency-dependent reflection coefficient Rp(k) that is a rational function encoding multiple internal
reflections. Barrera, Guzmán & Balaguer (1978) used the method of images to derive such integrals for a
