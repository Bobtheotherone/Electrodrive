36 . The infinite series can be summed in closed form only in limiting cases (e.g. ϵ2 → ∞ reduces to the
Kelvin image solution where only l = 0 term survives 37 38 ). In general, the image representation is an
infinite sequence: one can show that the same solution is obtained by replacing the sphere with an infinite
set of point charges located on the line through the sphere center and the original charge (a convergent
sequence approaching the center). In fact, the classic analysis by Kirkwood (1934) interprets the series as
an infinite image charge expansion for reaction field calculations. Norris (1995)】 explicitly constructed
the image system: a point charge q′ at the Kelvin image point r = dK = a2/dplus a continuous line
distribution of charge along the radius from the center to that image point 39 40 . This line-charge
density can be chosen so that each term of its multipole expansion reproduces the series coefficients
above. (For ϵ2/ϵ1  ∞, a c=ontinuous distribution is needed – a single point image is insufficient 41 .)
The image line charge formulation is discussed by Norris and by Lindell (Radio Sci., 27:1–8, 1992) 42
42 , who termed it an “electrostatic image theory” for the dielectric sphere. In summary, unlike the
conducting sphere, no finite combination of discrete images can satisfy both V and D continuity for a
dielectric sphere 41 43 . The infinite-series solution (or equivalent image distribution) is the accepted
Green’s function. The series converges for field points outside the sphere if r > d, and for field points
inside if r < a. It converges faster when the contrast ∣ϵ2−ϵ1∣ is small (since higher-order multipoles
have coefficients ∝ (ϵ2−ϵ1)) and when the charge is not too close to the sphere. If the charge
approaches the sphere (d → a+), the series develops a slow convergence (the terms ∼ (a/d)l+1
approach 1) and many multipoles are needed – this corresponds to the known strong field
enhancement in narrow gaps. In fact, as d → a, the needed truncation order lmax to achieve a given
accuracy grows roughly like lmax ∼ ln(1/l(n1(−γ)a/d)), where γ is a factor related to ϵϵ22+−ϵϵ11. Practically, for 
d/a = 1.1 (10% gap), perhaps tens of terms suffice; for d/a = 1.01 (1% gap), hundreds of terms may
be required to capture the near-contact singular field. Techniques like the use of spherical harmonics
of the second kind (logarithmic potentials) aka “logopoles”** have been developed by Majic & Le Ru
(2019) to accelerate convergence in this regime 44 45 . These functions effectively capture the line-charge
singularity inside the sphere, yielding a more rapidly convergent expansion than standard Legendre series. 
If the point charge is inside a dielectric sphere (radius a, permittivity ϵ2) embedded in medium ϵ1, one
similarly expands in harmonics. The roles of interior/exterior solutions swap: inside we have a Coulomb plus
l
reflected series, outside purely multipole series. The coefficients become Al = 4πqϵ2 ϵ1(lϵ+1−1)ϵ+2ϵ2l (ra′) for l ≥
0, etc. When ϵ1 → ∞ (sphere in a conducting medium), only the l = 0 term survives inside (uniform field),
consistent with the image-charge result that a dielectric sphere in a conducting host induces a single image
outside at r = a2/p (for a charge at radius p < a) 46 47 . A curious fact noted by van Siclen (AJP 56, 1142
(1988)) is that if one places the Kelvin image charge inside a dielectric sphere (instead of the proper infinite
series), the external field it produces together with the real external charge is independent of ϵ2 48 49 . In
other words, the combination “external charge + Kelvin image” yields the correct outside potential for any
sphere permittivity (equal to the conducting-sphere solution). Of course, the interior field will be wrong
except in the conductor limit – but this trick implies that the effect of finite ϵ2 is felt only in the higher
multipole terms (which vanish if ϵ2 → ∞). This was generalized by Redžić et al (2012) to spheroidal cases
50 . Practically, it suggests using the Kelvin image as a starting approximation for large but finite ϵ2, adding
corrections for the residual multipoles. Indeed,  Kirkwood (1957)  and  Friedman (1975)  introduced
approximate image-charge methods to replace the full series in molecular solvation models 51 52 .
Kirkwood’s approximation is essentially truncating at the dipole term (using one image); Friedman
proposed a single image located at the Kelvin image point but with magnitude chosen to match the exact
dipole moment (improving accuracy for moderate contrasts) 51 52 . These give errors on the order of a few
percent for low or moderate permittivity ratios and are widely used in “reaction field” models of solvent
