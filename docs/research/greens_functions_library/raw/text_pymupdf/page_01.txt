Planar Stratified Media Green’s Functions (Electrostatics)
Half‐Space  (Single  Interface): For  a  point  charge   at  height   above  a  planar  interface  between
permittivities 
 (above, where the charge resides) and 
 (below), the potential in the upper region can be
written as the superposition of the original charge and an image charge. The image magnitude is 
= 
, located at the mirror point symmetrically below the plane
. (Notably, if 
, then 
 has
the same sign as , implying a repulsive interaction – charges are repelled from lower-permittivity regions
.) The potential for 
 is then:
in cylindrical coordinates (ρ horizontal distance)
. This satisfies the interface conditions: continuity of 
at 
 and continuity of normal 
 (no surface charge at the boundary)
. In the lower region 
, the field is uniform with no internal image charge; one finds 
 with 
 so
that 
 is continuous
. Equivalently, the potential in 
 behaves as if the free charge were
effectively scaled by a factor 
 (for 
 above, 
 is as if charge 
 were in
vacuum). In the extreme cases, (i)
 (conducting lower half-space) gives 
 and the familiar
image method for a grounded plane
; (ii)
 (infinitely “low” permittivity) gives 
 (image of
same sign, fully repulsive). The induced bound surface-charge density on the interface is 
, which for a conductor (
) recovers 
. The force on
the point charge due to the interface is 
 (attractive for 
, repulsive if 
). The
image formulation above is in fact an exact solution for the static half-space problem
. 
Spectral Integral Representation: The same result can be obtained by a Fourier/Sommerfeld integral. The
full-space Green’s function in homogeneous medium is  
. For the half-space, one finds an
azimuthal Fourier-Bessel transform:
with 
 (static limit of the TM-wave reflection coefficient)
. Evaluating the
integral yields the above image expression. The term with 
 corresponds to the reflected field from
the interface. For multi-layer planar stratifications, one obtains multiple reflections: e.g. for a 3-layer (two
interfaces) system, the Green’s function can be written as a similar Sommerfeld integral but with a 
frequency-dependent reflection coefficient 
 that is a rational function encoding multiple internal
reflections. Barrera, Guzmán & Balaguer (1978) used the method of images to derive such integrals for a
