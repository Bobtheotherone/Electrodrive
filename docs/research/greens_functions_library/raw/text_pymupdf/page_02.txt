three-dielectric planar configuration
. The resulting potential expressions involve piecewise-defined
integrals (or infinite image charge series) for each region that satisfy the boundary conditions at both
interfaces. In general, no finite number of discrete image charges can exactly represent the field in multi-
layer dielectric media; instead one obtains either infinite image series or continuous distributions
(integrals). For instance, a point charge between two dielectric half-spaces produces an infinite series of
images in each layer (analogous to multiple mirror images in a Fabry–Pérot cavity) which sums to the exact
Green’s function
. These series/integrals converge rapidly when the source is far from the interfaces,
but can converge slowly for near-interface sources or high-contrast interfaces. Various techniques
(asymptotic extraction, Ewald summation, numerical steepest-descent integration) are used to accelerate
convergence of Sommerfeld integrals
. For quasi-static problems, it is common to partition the
Green’s function into a “direct” term plus a rapidly decaying reflected field; e.g. one can subtract the 
singular contribution and handle it analytically, then integrate the remainder numerically with fewer
discretization points
. Approximations via discrete image charges are also used: for example, Wait &
Spies (1964) proposed complex image charges to approximate the Sommerfeld integral of a dipole field in a
conductive half-space
 (the complex image method), achieving high accuracy by fitting a few images to
the continuous spectrum. Similar rational approximations exist for static/dc fields in layered media to avoid
direct integration. However, these are approximations; the exact solution generally resides in the spectral
integral form or an infinite series of images. 
Planar Layer Examples: A classical example is a charge on the interface (say in medium 1 at 
): it
induces a surface charge of magnitude 
 on the boundary such that the field in medium 2 is as if a charge
 were placed at the interface
. Another case: a charge embedded in a dielectric slab
of finite thickness between two different dielectric half-spaces. By multiple reflections, one can sum an
infinite geometric series of image charges in each region. If the slab is symmetric (same permittivity above
and below), the series simplifies (even and odd image symmetry). If the slab is very thin (small thickness
compared to source distance), asymptotic methods can treat the two interfaces as a single effective
interface  with  an  effective  reflection  coefficient  
 etc.,  accurate  to  
 where   is
thickness. If the source is very close to one interface (small gap), the first image dominates and higher-
order images (multiple reflections) contribute corrections that can be expanded in powers of the small
parameter. Conversely, if the source is far, one can expand the field as the free-space field plus a dipole term
proportional to 
 (for a distant charge, the interface effect looks like an induced dipole
layer). 
Key References (Planar Media): The plane interface problem was treated by Sommerfeld (1909) for EM
fields (the static limit yields the above forms).  Landau & Lifshitz derive the image charge result for a
dielectric half-space in Electrodynamics of Continuous Media (Problem 1 to §8). Jackson (3rd ed, §4.4) also
covers a point charge above a dielectric half-space (leading to a surface-charge integral solution and the
image-charge interpretation).  Ramo, Whinnery & Van Duzer (Fields and Waves, 1965) give the closed-
form solution for the static interface using Fourier transforms
. For multiple planar layers, Barrera
et al, Am. J. Phys. 46, 1172 (1978) gave explicit Fourier-integral forms (corrected by Serra et al (2015) for
sign errors
). The general formalism for layered media Green’s functions is given in texts like Chew
(1990) and  Kong (1986), using transmission line analogies for the reflection coefficient  
. In static
cases,  
 becomes real and non-dispersive (independent of   for Laplace’s equation), which is why the
integrals often evaluate to simple image expressions – indeed for a purely dielectric discontinuity the
integrand  
 is constant, allowing analytic integration to yield the simple  
 form. This
ceases to be true for frequency-dependent or more complicated stratifications, where
