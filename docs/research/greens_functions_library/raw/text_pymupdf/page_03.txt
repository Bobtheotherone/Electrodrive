the spectral parameter and no closed-form point-image exists (necessitating the so-called “Sommerfeld
integrals”). 
Green’s Functions for Spherical Boundaries (Method of Images for
Spheres)
Conducting Sphere (Kelvin’s Image Charge): A point charge   in an infinite homogeneous medium at
distance  from the center of a grounded conducting sphere (radius 
) induces an image charge 
 located along the line from the center through the real charge, at radius  
 from the
center
. This Kelvin image produces a potential that exactly cancels 
 on the conductor surface. The
resulting Green’s function (Dirichlet, 
 on sphere) is:
for a source at 
 outside the sphere (with 
). The induced surface charge density is found by the
image method as well: 
 for a point charge on the polar axis
, and the total induced charge is 
 (the conductor shields the external field)
. Kelvin (1845)
discovered this solution
, which was a cornerstone in the development of the method of images. The 
reciprocal problem (charge inside a grounded sphere) also yields a single image: if  is at radius 
inside, then an image 
 at radius 
 outside produces zero potential on the sphere
.
These classic results are given in Maxwell’s treatise and many textbooks (e.g. Smythe, Static & Dynamic
Electricity, 1968, provides derivations). Neumann (1883) already discussed the sphere image problem and
its relation to inversion symmetry
. The method can be generalized to other conductor shapes that are 
spherical inversions of a plane or sphere: e.g. a conducting spherical shell with inner/outer radii yields
image charges for interior/exterior problems via Kelvin inversion (a charge outside a grounded spherical
shell induces one image outside and one inside the shell). Another example: a conducting circular cylinder
can be solved by images in 2D (line charges); Kelvin inversion maps it to a line and sphere configuration.
These are all special cases where a finite set of image multipoles yields an exact solution. 
Dielectric Sphere in Homogeneous Medium: For a point charge near a dielectric (non-conducting) sphere,
no finite set of simple images exists – instead the solution can be expanded in an infinite series of
multipoles (or interpreted as an image  distribution inside the sphere). Consider a sphere of radius  ,
permittivity 
, in an infinite medium 
. Place a charge  at distance  from the center (outside the sphere).
The potential outside (
) can be expanded in spherical harmonics about the sphere:  
 
(with
 
).  Inside  the  sphere  (
),
 
. Applying the boundary conditions at 
 (continuity of 
 and 
) leads to the
coefficients (for 
):
For example, the dipole term
 gives 
, corresponding to an induced dipole
moment 
 (which matches the known polarizability of a dielectric sphere)
