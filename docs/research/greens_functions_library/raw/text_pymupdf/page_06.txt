coordinates. Bispherical coordinates exploit the fact that equipotentials of two-sphere systems are level
surfaces of a certain coordinate ; the Green’s function for two conducting spheres (or a sphere and a plane
as the plane is a sphere of infinite radius) can be expanded in Legendre functions 
 of non-integer degree
(the so-called toroidal harmonics). This yields an exact infinite series for the potential, from which one can
extract asymptotic behavior. For small  , the capacitance  
 of a sphere-plane system behaves as  
 (like a quasi-parallel plate with a logarithmic correction) – this comes from the
dominant large-  behavior of the series. The field in the narrow gap is extremely high (formally  
 on  small  patch  area  
),  so  discretization  of  charge  images  can  become  ill-conditioned.
Numerical solvers (BEM, etc.) use mesh refinement in the gap and on the sphere’s near-face to capture this
boundary-layer field. Often a proximity parameter
 is used: for 
, one can derive a singular
asymptotic expansion for the field: e.g. the maximum surface field on the sphere scales like  
times the field of an isolated sphere. Error estimates for truncating the image series: if we truncate after 
image pairs (sphere-plane iterations), the error in potential near the gap is on the order of the next image
charge magnitude 
. For large separation 
, only the first image (plane’s 
) is
significant and the error decays as 
 – very fast. 
For  two finite spheres (both conducting), the image method likewise gives an infinite double series of
point charges inside each sphere. This was studied by King (1934) and others; the exact series solution for
two-sphere capacitance and force was derived by Lord Rayleigh (1897) using bispherical harmonics. There
is no simple closed-form formula; one must sum the series or use approximation formulas valid in certain
limits (e.g. small  or large ). For mixed dielectric spheres influencing each other, one can again set up
dual infinite series of multipoles. For instance, two dielectric spheres in vacuum will polarize each other: one
can expand each sphere’s response in multipoles, with coefficients that depend on the external field applied
by the other sphere’s multipoles – this leads to a  matrix equation coupling the two sets of coefficients.
Solving that yields a double series (the method is analogous to multiple scattering theory). Only in limiting
cases (like one sphere much larger than the other, or extreme permittivity ratios) can one find simplified
image approximations.  Fikioris (1977) and others have looked at two-sphere polarization; generally one
must truncate for numerical evaluation. 
Sphere near a Dielectric Interface: This hybrid problem (e.g. a dielectric or conducting sphere close to a
dielectric  half-space)  is  very  challenging  analytically.  No  closed-form  Green’s  function  is  known.  One
approach is the method of images with multipoles: the presence of the interface can be accounted by an
infinite set of image multipoles (located as a mirror distribution of the sphere’s charges) plus possibly
continuous distributions. For example, a conducting sphere above a dielectric plane might be approximated
by combining the sphere-plane image series (assuming the plane is conducting) with corrections for the
fact that the plane is actually dielectric. Another approach: use  bispherical coordinates if the sphere
intersects the plane (for a sphere partially embedded in a dielectric, effectively two-sphere coordinates with
one sphere of infinite radius). Some special cases have analytic results:  e.g. a conducting sphere half-
embedded in a dielectric half-space – by symmetry, this can be treated by image charges distributed along a
line (like the method of  odd extension across the interface, yielding an integral equation). In general,
however,  these  mixed  problems  are  solved  with  numerical  methods  (BEM  or  multipole  expansions
truncated at high order). 
Failure of Finite Image Solutions: In summary, apart from the canonical geometries (plane, sphere,
infinite cylinder,  maybe ellipsoid in certain orientations),  finite discrete image systems do not exist for
most conductor–dielectric setups
. The method of images “fails” in the sense that one needs either
an infinite number of images or an image distribution (line, surface, etc.). A famous example is the dielectric
