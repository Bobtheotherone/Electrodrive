1934, J. Chem. Phys.), no finite image; image interpreted as point + line charge
.  (4) Charge inside a
dielectric sphere – similar series (see  Neumann 1883 for early treatment
).  (5) Coated sphere with
concentric layers – series solution (see Mie theory static limit; Pyati 1993 for inversion approach
). (6)
Two conducting spheres – bispherical harmonic expansion (see Jeffery 1912, Snow 1952 for capacitance
series). (7) Dielectric sphere-plane – no closed form; see Image multipole method by Zhukauskas 1988
(approximate) or numerical BEM. (8) General layered Green’s function – spectral integrals (Sommerfeld) as
in Chew’s “Waves and Fields in Inhomogeneous Media” (1990). (9) Novel solution techniques – e.g. Majic
& Le Ru (2019) “logopoles” for fast sphere series
; Yaghjian (1980) for complex images in stratified
media. These sources provide a wealth of formulas, convergence analysis, and guidance for tackling new
configurations that might admit near-analytic solutions via clever combinations of known Green’s functions
and transforms.
