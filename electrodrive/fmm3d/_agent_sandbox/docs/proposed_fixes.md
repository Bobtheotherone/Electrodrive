- M2L/local rescaling: audit `_rescale_locals_packed` numerically shows ratio exponent `(l+1)` sensitivity; verify whether tree-level callers use ratio = S_from/S_to consistently. Consider enforcing explicit rescale in M2L builds or updating audit collocation rules if mismatch persists.
- L2L translation drift: high-`l` bias suggests translation matrix `_compute_l2l_matrix` may be built with incorrect dimensionless shift or collocation radius; inspect how `t_dimless` is normalized relative to `global_scale` in tree downward pass.
- Large-N stress failures: `rel_l2_err` ~ 1e-3–1e-2 likely driven by local translation/rescaling bias; once localized, patch translation scaling and rerun `test_fmm_stress_large_n` to confirm.
- New L2L sweep: bias and per-order errors grow sharply with `|t|/S`, especially for high `l`; suggests translation matrix scaling or missing rescale factor tied to shift magnitude rather than random direction.
- FMM stress grid (partial, N=512): global errors stay O(1e-3–1e-2) even at p=8; indicates high-order degradation survives end-to-end. Extend to higher N when runtime allows.
- L2L usage stats (stress_2048_uniform / stress_4096_clusters): observed |t|/S distributions (log in `l2l_usage_stats.jsonl`) overlap |t|/S ≈ 0.5–0.75 where L2L sweep shows >O(1) high-ℓ bias—likely root cause of large-N failures. Once M2L sweep is analyzed, quantify combined impact.
