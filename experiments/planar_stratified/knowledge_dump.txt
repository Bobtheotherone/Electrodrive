Planar Stratified Media Green’s Functions (Electrostatics)
Half‐Space (Single Interface): For a point charge q at height d above a planar interface between
permittivities ϵ1 (above, where the charge resides) and ϵ2 (below), the potential in the upper region can be
written as the superposition of the original charge and an image charge. The image magnitude is



                                                                q′
   ϵ1 − ϵ2
=          q , located at the mirror point symmetrically below the plane 1 . (Notably, if ϵ2 < ϵ1 , then q ′ has
   ϵ1 + ϵ2
the same sign as q , implying a repulsive interaction – charges are repelled from lower-permittivity regions
  1 .) The potential for z > 0 is then:




                                           [                                                            ],
                                       q             1                    ϵ1 − ϵ2             1

in cylindrical coordinates (ρ horizontal distance)   2    . This satisfies the interface conditions: continuity of V
at z = 0 and continuity of normal ϵEz (no surface charge at the boundary)                 3   2   . In the lower region
z < 0, the field is uniform with no internal image charge; one finds Ez<0 = (1 − ν)Eorig with ν = ϵϵ22 −ϵ  +ϵ1 so
                                                                                                             1


that Ez is continuous 4 5 . Equivalently, the potential in z < 0 behaves as if the free charge were
effectively scaled by a factor 2ϵ1 /(ϵ1 + ϵ2 ) 6 (for ϵ1 = 1 above, Vz<0 is as if charge 2q/(ϵ1 + ϵ2 ) were in
vacuum). In the extreme cases, (i) ϵ2 → ∞ (conducting lower half-space) gives q ′ = −q and the familiar
image method for a grounded plane 2 ; (ii) ϵ2 → 0 (infinitely “low” permittivity) gives q ′ = +q (image of
same sign, fully repulsive). The induced bound surface-charge density on the interface is σb (ρ) =
−ν 2π(ρ2q+d

            2 )3/2
                   7  8 , which for a conductor (ν = 1) recovers σ(ρ) = −         qd
                                                                             2π(ρ2 +d2 )3/2
                                                                                            9 10 . The force on

the point charge due to the interface is Fz = − 16πϵ ϵ d2 (attractive for ϵ2 > ϵ1 , repulsive if ϵ2 < ϵ1 ). The

image formulation above is in fact an exact solution for the static half-space problem 11                12 .




Spectral Integral Representation: The same result can be obtained by a Fourier/Sommerfeld integral. The
                                                                1 1
full-space Green’s function in homogeneous medium is G0 = 4πϵ     R . For the half-space, one finds an
azimuthal Fourier-Bessel transform:

                                          ∞

                                                        ′                  ′
                   G(ρ, z, z ′ ) =
                                     2π 0 2ϵ1 k


with Rp (k) = (ϵ1 − ϵ2 )/(ϵ1 + ϵ2 ) (static limit of the TM-wave reflection coefficient)            6   2    . Evaluating the
                                                                     −k(z+z ′ )
integral yields the above image expression. The term with e                       corresponds to the reflected field from
the interface. For multi-layer planar stratifications, one obtains multiple reflections: e.g. for a 3-layer (two
interfaces) system, the Green’s function can be written as a similar Sommerfeld integral but with a
frequency-dependent reflection coefficient Rp (k) that is a rational function encoding multiple internal
reflections. Barrera, Guzmán & Balaguer (1978) used the method of images to derive such integrals for a




                                                                1

three-dielectric planar configuration 13 14 . The resulting potential expressions involve piecewise-defined
integrals (or infinite image charge series) for each region that satisfy the boundary conditions at both
interfaces. In general, no finite number of discrete image charges can exactly represent the field in multi-
layer dielectric media; instead one obtains either infinite image series or continuous distributions
(integrals). For instance, a point charge between two dielectric half-spaces produces an infinite series of
images in each layer (analogous to multiple mirror images in a Fabry–Pérot cavity) which sums to the exact
Green’s function 13 15 . These series/integrals converge rapidly when the source is far from the interfaces,
but can converge slowly for near-interface sources or high-contrast interfaces. Various techniques
(asymptotic extraction, Ewald summation, numerical steepest-descent integration) are used to accelerate
convergence of Sommerfeld integrals 16 17 . For quasi-static problems, it is common to partition the
Green’s function into a “direct” term plus a rapidly decaying reflected field; e.g. one can subtract the k = 0
singular contribution and handle it analytically, then integrate the remainder numerically with fewer
discretization points 18 19 . Approximations via discrete image charges are also used: for example, Wait &
Spies (1964) proposed complex image charges to approximate the Sommerfeld integral of a dipole field in a
conductive half-space 20 (the complex image method), achieving high accuracy by fitting a few images to
the continuous spectrum. Similar rational approximations exist for static/dc fields in layered media to avoid
direct integration. However, these are approximations; the exact solution generally resides in the spectral
integral form or an infinite series of images.


Planar Layer Examples: A classical example is a charge on the interface (say in medium 1 at z = 0+ ): it
induces a surface charge of magnitude q ′ on the boundary such that the field in medium 2 is as if a charge
2q/(ϵ1 + ϵ2 ) were placed at the interface 6     21 . Another case: a charge embedded in a dielectric slab

of finite thickness between two different dielectric half-spaces. By multiple reflections, one can sum an
infinite geometric series of image charges in each region. If the slab is symmetric (same permittivity above
and below), the series simplifies (even and odd image symmetry). If the slab is very thin (small thickness
compared to source distance), asymptotic methods can treat the two interfaces as a single effective
interface with an effective reflection coefficient Reff ≈ R12 + R23 etc., accurate to O(t) where t is
thickness. If the source is very close to one interface (small gap), the first image dominates and higher-
order images (multiple reflections) contribute corrections that can be expanded in powers of the small
parameter. Conversely, if the source is far, one can expand the field as the free-space field plus a dipole term
proportional to (ϵ2 − ϵ1 )/(ϵ2 + ϵ1 ) (for a distant charge, the interface effect looks like an induced dipole
layer).


Key References (Planar Media): The plane interface problem was treated by Sommerfeld (1909) for EM
fields (the static limit yields the above forms). Landau & Lifshitz derive the image charge result for a
dielectric half-space in Electrodynamics of Continuous Media (Problem 1 to §8). Jackson (3rd ed, §4.4) also
covers a point charge above a dielectric half-space (leading to a surface-charge integral solution and the
image-charge interpretation). Ramo, Whinnery & Van Duzer (Fields and Waves, 1965) give the closed-
form solution for the static interface using Fourier transforms 22 23 . For multiple planar layers, Barrera
et al, Am. J. Phys. 46, 1172 (1978) gave explicit Fourier-integral forms (corrected by Serra et al (2015) for
sign errors 24 25 ). The general formalism for layered media Green’s functions is given in texts like Chew
(1990) and Kong (1986), using transmission line analogies for the reflection coefficient Rp (k). In static
cases, Rp becomes real and non-dispersive (independent of k for Laplace’s equation), which is why the
integrals often evaluate to simple image expressions – indeed for a purely dielectric discontinuity the
integrand Rp is constant, allowing analytic integration to yield the simple 1/ ρ2 + (z + d)2 form. This
ceases to be true for frequency-dependent or more complicated stratifications, where Rp (k) is a function of

the spectral parameter and no closed-form point-image exists (necessitating the so-called “Sommerfeld
integrals”).


Green’s Functions for Spherical Boundaries (Method of Images for
Spheres)
Conducting Sphere (Kelvin’s Image Charge): A point charge q in an infinite homogeneous medium at
distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere (radius a < d) induces an image charge qK =
− q a/d located along the line from the center through the real charge, at radius dK = a2 /d from the
center 26 27 . This Kelvin image produces a potential that exactly cancels V on the conductor surface. The
resulting Green’s function (Dirichlet, ϕ = 0 on sphere) is:

                                                  1      1             a/d
                            Gsphere (r, r′ ) =       (         −                   ),

for a source at r′ outside the sphere (with ∣r′ ∣ > a). The induced surface charge density is found by the
                                                                   q (a2 −d2 )
image method as well: σ(θ) = −ϵ0 ∂n ϕ∣r=a = − 4πa (a2 +d2 −2ad cos θ)3/2 for a point charge on the polar axis
 28   29 , and the total induced charge is   −q (the conductor shields the external field) 30 . Kelvin (1845)
discovered this solution 31 , which was a cornerstone in the development of the method of images. The
reciprocal problem (charge inside a grounded sphere) also yields a single image: if q is at radius p < a
                       ′
inside, then an image qK = −q a/p at radius a2 /p outside produces zero potential on the sphere 32                  33 .

These classic results are given in Maxwell’s treatise and many textbooks (e.g. Smythe, Static & Dynamic
Electricity, 1968, provides derivations). Neumann (1883) already discussed the sphere image problem and
its relation to inversion symmetry 34 . The method can be generalized to other conductor shapes that are
spherical inversions of a plane or sphere: e.g. a conducting spherical shell with inner/outer radii yields
image charges for interior/exterior problems via Kelvin inversion (a charge outside a grounded spherical
shell induces one image outside and one inside the shell). Another example: a conducting circular cylinder
can be solved by images in 2D (line charges); Kelvin inversion maps it to a line and sphere configuration.
These are all special cases where a finite set of image multipoles yields an exact solution.


Dielectric Sphere in Homogeneous Medium: For a point charge near a dielectric (non-conducting) sphere,
no finite set of simple images exists – instead the solution can be expanded in an infinite series of
multipoles (or interpreted as an image distribution inside the sphere). Consider a sphere of radius a,
permittivity ϵ2 , in an infinite medium ϵ1 . Place a charge q at distance d from the center (outside the sphere).
The potential outside (r > d) can be expanded in spherical harmonics about the sphere: Vext (r, θ) =
 q 1        ∞       al
4πϵ1 r> + ∑l=0 Bl r l+1 Pl (cos θ) (with r> = max(r, d)). Inside the sphere (r < a), Vint (r, θ) =
   ∞
∑l=0 Al rl Pl (cos θ). Applying the boundary conditions at r = a (continuity of V and ϵ∂r V ) leads to the
coefficients (for l ≥ 0):

                q        ϵ2 − ϵ1      a l+1                                  q        ϵ2 − ϵ1     l + 1 − 2l−1 l

 36 . The infinite series can be summed in closed form only in limiting cases (e.g.       ϵ2 → ∞ reduces to the
Kelvin image solution where only l = 0 term survives     37   38 ). In general, the image representation is an

infinite sequence: one can show that the same solution is obtained by replacing the sphere with an infinite
set of point charges located on the line through the sphere center and the original charge (a convergent
sequence approaching the center). In fact, the classic analysis by Kirkwood (1934) interprets the series as
an infinite image charge expansion for reaction field calculations. Norris (1995)】 explicitly constructed
the image system: a point charge q ′ at the Kelvin image point r = dK = a2 /d plus a continuous line
distribution of charge along the radius from the center to that image point 39 40 . This line-charge
density can be chosen so that each term of its multipole expansion reproduces the series coefficients
above. (For ϵ2 /ϵ1  ∞, a continuous
                           =          distribution is needed – a single point image is insufficient 41 .)
The image line charge formulation is discussed by Norris and by Lindell (Radio Sci., 27:1–8, 1992) 42
 42 , who termed it an “electrostatic image theory” for the dielectric sphere. In summary, unlike the

conducting sphere, no finite combination of discrete images can satisfy both V and D continuity for a
dielectric sphere 41 43 . The infinite-series solution (or equivalent image distribution) is the accepted
Green’s function. The series converges for field points outside the sphere if r > d, and for field points
inside if r < a. It converges faster when the contrast ∣ϵ2 − ϵ1 ∣ is small (since higher-order multipoles
have coefficients ∝ (ϵ2 − ϵ1 )) and when the charge is not too close to the sphere. If the charge
approaches the sphere (d → a+ ), the series develops a slow convergence (the terms ∼ (a/d)l+1
approach 1) and many multipoles are needed – this corresponds to the known strong field
enhancement in narrow gaps. In fact, as d → a, the needed truncation order lmax to achieve a given
                                       ln(1/(1−a/d))
accuracy grows roughly like lmax ∼          ln(γ)    , where γ is a factor related to ϵϵ2 −ϵ1
                                                                                              . Practically, for
                                                                                        2 +ϵ1

d/a = 1.1 (10% gap), perhaps tens of terms suffice; for d/a = 1.01 (1% gap), hundreds of terms may
be required to capture the near-contact singular field. Techniques like the use of spherical harmonics
of the second kind (logarithmic potentials) aka “logopoles”** have been developed by Majic & Le Ru
(2019) to accelerate convergence in this regime 44 45 . These functions effectively capture the line-charge
singularity inside the sphere, yielding a more rapidly convergent expansion than standard Legendre series.


If the point charge is inside a dielectric sphere (radius a, permittivity ϵ2 ) embedded in medium ϵ1 , one
similarly expands in harmonics. The roles of interior/exterior solutions swap: inside we have a Coulomb plus
                                                                                                             l

0, etc. When ϵ1 → ∞ (sphere in a conducting medium), only the l = 0 term survives inside (uniform field),
consistent with the image-charge result that a dielectric sphere in a conducting host induces a single image
outside at r = a2 /p (for a charge at radius p < a) 46 47 . A curious fact noted by van Siclen (AJP 56, 1142
(1988)) is that if one places the Kelvin image charge inside a dielectric sphere (instead of the proper infinite
series), the external field it produces together with the real external charge is independent of ϵ2 48 49 . In
other words, the combination “external charge + Kelvin image” yields the correct outside potential for any
sphere permittivity (equal to the conducting-sphere solution). Of course, the interior field will be wrong
except in the conductor limit – but this trick implies that the effect of finite ϵ2 is felt only in the higher
multipole terms (which vanish if ϵ2 → ∞). This was generalized by Redžić et al (2012) to spheroidal cases
 50 . Practically, it suggests using the Kelvin image as a starting approximation for large but finite      ϵ2 , adding
corrections for the residual multipoles. Indeed, Kirkwood (1957) and Friedman (1975) introduced
approximate image-charge methods to replace the full series in molecular solvation models 51 52 .
Kirkwood’s approximation is essentially truncating at the dipole term (using one image); Friedman
proposed a single image located at the Kelvin image point but with magnitude chosen to match the exact
dipole moment (improving accuracy for moderate contrasts) 51 52 . These give errors on the order of a few
percent for low or moderate permittivity ratios and are widely used in “reaction field” models of solvent

dielectrics 52 53 . Modern extensions use multiple discrete images (e.g. 3 or 4 image charges per sphere) to
fit higher multipole moments, yielding accuracies of 10^(-4) with far fewer terms than the full series 54 55 .
Such methods, combined with FMM (fast multipole method), allow efficient O(N ) simulations of many-
charge systems with dielectric spheres 56 .


Coated (Layered) Spheres: A dielectric-coated conducting sphere is another geometry amenable to
analytic solution. Suppose a conducting core radius a is covered by a concentric dielectric shell (outer radius
b, permittivity ϵ2 ), embedded in medium ϵ1 . A point charge in the outside region can be solved by matching
boundary conditions at r = b (dielectric interface) and r = a (conductor). One finds an infinite series again:
                             q
outside r > b, V = 4πϵ r + ∑l Bl (a/r)l+1 Pl (cos θ); in the shell a < r < b, V = ∑(Cl r l +
                              1 >
Dl r− l−1 )Pl (cos θ); inside the conductor r < a, V = 0. The coefficients are determined by applying (i)
V = 0 at r = a (implying Cl al + Dl a−l−1 = 0), and (ii) continuity of V and ϵ∂r V at r = b. The algebra
leads to formulas for Bl in terms of ϵ1 , ϵ2 , a, b, d. These are lengthy, but in special cases they simplify. Pyati
(Radio Sci. 28:1105, 1993) applied Kelvin inversion to this problem 57 58 : using the fact that inversion in a
sphere of radius     ab maps the coated sphere to a simpler geometry, he obtained an analytic image
solution. Essentially, the presence of the coating means the image of a charge is no longer a single charge:
one gets a doublet of images – an image charge and an image dipole (or higher multipole) located at the
Kelvin image point – to satisfy the two conditions at the interface. For example, for a very thin coating
(b = a + δ , δ ≪ a), one can treat the coating as a perturbation: the image charge is approximately Kelvin’s
−qa/d, plus a small dipole at the same location to account for the finite ϵ2 . The dipole moment can be
solved from a first-order perturbation of the boundary condition: it comes out proportional to (ϵ2 − ∞),
which for large ϵ2 is small. Conversely, if the shell permittivity is low, the dipole moment might reinforce the
primary image (if ϵ2 < ϵ1 , the dipole term adds a repulsive component). In general, series solutions for
coated spheres are given in treatises like Stratton’s Electromagnetic Theory (1941, §3.25) and in many
antenna-scattering analyses (the static limit of Mie theory). The coefficients often involve the spherical
harmonic recursion for three-layer systems. The effect of the coating is to modify the effective polarization
                                                                                  ϵ2 (2ϵ1 +ϵ2 )−(ϵ1 −ϵ2 )( ab )3 (2ϵ1 +ϵ2 )
of the sphere: e.g. the polarizability of a coated metal sphere is α = 4πϵ1 a3        ϵ2 (2ϵ1 +ϵ2 )+2(ϵ1 −ϵ2 )( ab )3 ϵ1 ,
                              ϵ2 −ϵ1
which reduces to the earlier 2ϵ +ϵ for b = a, and to the perfect conductor value (polarizability = 4πϵ1 a3 ) as
                                2   1
ϵ2 → ∞. This indicates that a high-ϵ coating can nearly mimic a metal even if the core is just metal (which is
already conductor, trivial here) – more interesting is a dielectric core with a different coating, which can
produce resonant polarization effects if ϵ2 is lower than ϵ1 . Generally, however, no finite set of simple
images exists for coated spheres either; one again deals with infinite series or images of increasing
multipole order. Pyati’s work shows that Kelvin’s inversion can simplify the algebra but still yields an infinite
series of image multipoles (just in a perhaps more organized way).


Multiple Spheres and Sphere–Plane Configurations: The method of images can be iterated to handle two
conducting spheres or a sphere near a conducting plane, but the result is an infinite recursive series of
images. For example, a conducting sphere above a conducting infinite plane: the plane induces an image
charge (Kelvin’s method for a plane says put −q below the plane); but that image below the plane is like a
point charge near the sphere (below it), which induces another image in the sphere, which then induces
another in the plane, and so on ad infinitum. Physically, the two objects “mirror” charges back and forth. In
fact, using the sphere’s Kelvin formula and the plane’s mirror formula alternately yields an infinite sequence
of image charges of geometrically decreasing magnitude. In the sphere-plane case, these image charges lie
on the perpendicular axis through the sphere center, at progressively smaller distances, and the series
converges fast if the gap g = d − a is not too small. In the limit g ≪ a (sphere almost touching the plane),
the method-of-images series converges slowly; instead one can use the method of bispherical




                                                            5

coordinates. Bispherical coordinates exploit the fact that equipotentials of two-sphere systems are level
surfaces of a certain coordinate η ; the Green’s function for two conducting spheres (or a sphere and a plane
as the plane is a sphere of infinite radius) can be expanded in Legendre functions Pν of non-integer degree
(the so-called toroidal harmonics). This yields an exact infinite series for the potential, from which one can
extract asymptotic behavior. For small g , the capacitance C of a sphere-plane system behaves as C ∼
2πϵ0 a/ ln(4a/g) + O(1) (like a quasi-parallel plate with a logarithmic correction) – this comes from the
dominant large-l behavior of the series. The field in the narrow gap is extremely high (formally E ∼
    q
2πϵ0 Agap on small patch area Agap ), so discretization of charge images can become ill-conditioned.
Numerical solvers (BEM, etc.) use mesh refinement in the gap and on the sphere’s near-face to capture this
boundary-layer field. Often a proximity parameter λ = g/a is used: for λ ≪ 1, one can derive a singular
asymptotic expansion for the field: e.g. the maximum surface field on the sphere scales like Emax ∼ λ1
times the field of an isolated sphere. Error estimates for truncating the image series: if we truncate after N
image pairs (sphere-plane iterations), the error in potential near the gap is on the order of the next image
charge magnitude ∼ (a − d)N +1 /d N +1 . For large separation d ≫ a, only the first image (plane’s −q ) is
significant and the error decays as (a/d)2(N +1) – very fast.


For two finite spheres (both conducting), the image method likewise gives an infinite double series of
point charges inside each sphere. This was studied by King (1934) and others; the exact series solution for
two-sphere capacitance and force was derived by Lord Rayleigh (1897) using bispherical harmonics. There
is no simple closed-form formula; one must sum the series or use approximation formulas valid in certain
limits (e.g. small g or large g ). For mixed dielectric spheres influencing each other, one can again set up
dual infinite series of multipoles. For instance, two dielectric spheres in vacuum will polarize each other: one
can expand each sphere’s response in multipoles, with coefficients that depend on the external field applied
by the other sphere’s multipoles – this leads to a matrix equation coupling the two sets of coefficients.
Solving that yields a double series (the method is analogous to multiple scattering theory). Only in limiting
cases (like one sphere much larger than the other, or extreme permittivity ratios) can one find simplified
image approximations. Fikioris (1977) and others have looked at two-sphere polarization; generally one
must truncate for numerical evaluation.


Sphere near a Dielectric Interface: This hybrid problem (e.g. a dielectric or conducting sphere close to a
dielectric half-space) is very challenging analytically. No closed-form Green’s function is known. One
approach is the method of images with multipoles: the presence of the interface can be accounted by an
infinite set of image multipoles (located as a mirror distribution of the sphere’s charges) plus possibly
continuous distributions. For example, a conducting sphere above a dielectric plane might be approximated
by combining the sphere-plane image series (assuming the plane is conducting) with corrections for the
fact that the plane is actually dielectric. Another approach: use bispherical coordinates if the sphere
intersects the plane (for a sphere partially embedded in a dielectric, effectively two-sphere coordinates with
one sphere of infinite radius). Some special cases have analytic results: e.g. a conducting sphere half-
embedded in a dielectric half-space – by symmetry, this can be treated by image charges distributed along a
line (like the method of odd extension across the interface, yielding an integral equation). In general,
however, these mixed problems are solved with numerical methods (BEM or multipole expansions
truncated at high order).


Failure of Finite Image Solutions: In summary, apart from the canonical geometries (plane, sphere,
infinite cylinder, maybe ellipsoid in certain orientations), finite discrete image systems do not exist for
most conductor–dielectric setups 59 60 . The method of images “fails” in the sense that one needs either
an infinite number of images or an image distribution (line, surface, etc.). A famous example is the dielectric



                                                       6

[PAGE 7]
sphere: no finite collection of Coulomb charges can satisfy the boundary conditions 41 . Another example:
an ellipsoidal conductor requires an infinite series of images lying along a line (the so-called Pellat’s solution
involves an integral of line charges). Similarly, a point charge in front of a dielectric slab cannot be
represented by a few images – one gets a continuous charge “image” smeared along the perpendicular
through the slab. These impossibility results stem from the uniqueness theorem: the Green’s function in
such cases has branch-cut singularities (the continuous spectra corresponding to continuum of image
charges). A rigorous statement is that the method of images in the form of finite discrete sources works iff
the boundary is an equipotential of a conformal inversion of a sphere or plane (so basically plane, sphere, or
special cases like coaxal cylinders in 2D). For arbitrary shapes or layered media, one resorts to infinite series
or integrals.


Parameter Scaling & Numerical Considerations: It is crucial to nondimensionalize lengths by a
characteristic scale (sphere radius, etc.) and to form contrast parameters that govern the solution. Common
dimensionless groups include the permivitty contrast β = ϵϵ2 −ϵ  +ϵ (which appeared in many formulas above
                                                                   1
                                                                 2   1
as image-charge factors), the normalized separation s = d/a (distance of a charge or second object in
units of sphere radius), and the gap ratio g/a. In series expansions, small β can be used as an expansion
parameter (for instance, for a weakly polarizable sphere, Bl ≈ β q/(4πϵ1 ) (a/d) l+1 ). In contrast, β → ±1
(huge contrast in either direction) is a singular limit – e.g. β → 1 corresponds to a perfect conductor image.
                                                                                              (∞)
One often expands about those extremes: for a high-ϵ sphere, one can write Bl = Bl           + ΔBl where
 (∞)
Bl is 0 for l > 0 and ΔBl is proportional to 1/ϵ2 . This yields a small parameter 1/ϵ2 . Likewise, for a low-
ϵ inclusion, one can treat it as a small perturbation (since β ≈ −1, one might set ϵ2 = ϵ1 δ with δ ≪ 1 and
expand). As for geometry, small gap g ≪ a expansions often use g/a as a parameter: e.g. capacitance of
sphere-plane has an asymptotic expansion in powers of ln(a/g) and g/a. For far-field expansions, one
uses a/d ≪ 1: e.g. the potential of a sphere of charge Q at large distance looks like Q/(4πϵ1 r)+ dipole
term + etc., with each successive multipole ∼ (a/d)l . Truncating at dipole yields an error ∼ O((a/d)3 ).
Many numerical schemes (method of moments, multipole accelerators) leverage such truncation for distant
interactions.


When implementing image-based solutions or series numerically, one must ensure convergence and
stability. For example, the Legendre series for a dielectric sphere can suffer catastrophic cancellation for
large l if summed naively; using recurrence relations or log-scaling for the coefficients is recommended. In
boundary element collocation, placing collocation points near sharp edges or small gaps is essential: e.g.
for a sphere near a plane, a finer mesh (or denser sampling for the method of moments) is needed in the
region of closest approach, because induced surface charge density behaves like σ ∼ (g/ρ)1/2 near the
contact point (a square-root singularity). Mesh grading proportional to distance to contact is often used
to capture this. In iterative image constructions, one monitors the magnitude of the last-added image
charge: stopping when it falls below some tolerance ensures the error in potential is bounded by that
magnitude. For instance, in the two-sphere problem, if the N th image has charge qN , the error in potential
is O(qN /q); since qN /q ∼ (a/d)N (for large d) or ∼ (1 − g/a)N (for small gap), one can estimate how
many images are required.


Known Results Summary: To conclude this technical compendium, we list some notable special-case
solutions and references: (1) A charge above a dielectric half-space – exact potential via one image charge
(with magnitude q ′ = (ϵ1 − ϵ2 )/(ϵ1 + ϵ2 )q ) 1 , first derived by Sommerfeld and found in many textbooks
(e.g. Jackson, Eq. 4.19). (2) Charge outside a grounded conducting sphere – Kelvin’s image solution (1845)
  26 . (3) Charge outside a dielectric sphere – infinite series solution (e.g. Stratton 1941, p. 147; Kirkwood

1934, J. Chem. Phys.), no finite image; image interpreted as point + line charge 39 . (4) Charge inside a
dielectric sphere – similar series (see Neumann 1883 for early treatment 34 ). (5) Coated sphere with
concentric layers – series solution (see Mie theory static limit; Pyati 1993 for inversion approach 57 ). (6)
Two conducting spheres – bispherical harmonic expansion (see Jeffery 1912, Snow 1952 for capacitance
series). (7) Dielectric sphere-plane – no closed form; see Image multipole method by Zhukauskas 1988
(approximate) or numerical BEM. (8) General layered Green’s function – spectral integrals (Sommerfeld) as
in Chew’s “Waves and Fields in Inhomogeneous Media” (1990). (9) Novel solution techniques – e.g. Majic
& Le Ru (2019) “logopoles” for fast sphere series 44 45 ; Yaghjian (1980) for complex images in stratified
media. These sources provide a wealth of formulas, convergence analysis, and guidance for tackling new
configurations that might admit near-analytic solutions via clever combinations of known Green’s functions
and transforms.
